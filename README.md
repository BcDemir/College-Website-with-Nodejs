# College Website
This is a website developed with Node js in MVC architecture. MongoDB is used as database and EJS is used for views. 

The main objective of this project was to perform CRUD operations on the website such as:
- Inserting student details on the database
- Inserting details of a course to the databse
- A display page to dispaly all students if you login as a tutor
- Same page can edit and delete the details of the students
- A page to see all courses and students can enroll to desired courses

app.js file contains get and post methods and directs them to the controller. Various views are created in order to manage CRUD operations. All methods are in a single controller file. Two models were created to use in the database. These are user model for students and subject model for courses.
